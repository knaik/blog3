I did another 10k. It seems odd to care about privacy so much while I still upload to Strava. I fell on sharp gravel and got a few bad cuts and i tore the skin off the tip of my pinky. That hurts still to type on. And my elbow that's cut. I can't put pressure on either, so typing has become an exercise in how to use the pinky the least. As a programmer, that's hard. So I keep reopening the wound. Hopefully I will be able to get some sleep tonight
