I set up steam stream and GeForce now and it's been smooth sailing, jk there's tons of bugs and Detroit become human fails to boot. Any non steam bought games bugs out. Also GeForce now lost 2k games including borderlands. GeForce now gives you a virtual instance so I can play anywhere but honestly the gaming laptop i have is faster
