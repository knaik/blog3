Keeping up with submitting and thinking about 3 hackathons in a single weekend is hard. And another one next weekend. I found out that I registered for hobbyhacks which is actually shehacks and you can't submit as solo. and I consider myself non-binary(he/him). I saw that the mentoring in that hackathon compared to the mentoring in other hackathons was very different. Female in Stem mentoring is a lot nicer, and I wonder if it's because they are pushing their hardest to break the stigma of "Real developers started coding at 13 years old". I really appreciated the mentoring. However I feel embarrassed about coming out as nonbinary or openly stating my bisexuality. No one reads this blog.

Also I may have said this already but I am returning that chromebook. Too bad, it seemed nice but I think I will jump back into a "gaming" laptop. I miss my ThinkPad workstation so much but it seems like gaming pcs are what workstations used to be and workstations are now made mainly for IT ease of deployment. The current state of not having a high end ryzen chip with a great display is proof of where the priorities are. 


I have to decide between a 4k oled DCI P3 and 144hz ips 99% sRGB. 



That hackathon made me question more about what I truely identify as and it's important to know one's self.
