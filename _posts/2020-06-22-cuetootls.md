# Cuetools 

For gpu accelerated flac encoding, make sure your nvidia gpu is set to force use of your Quadro graphics card in order to allow opengl acceleration. This is true mainly for laptops with smart switching between integrated and discrete graphics. 


My graphics card supports opencl afaik. but cuetools seems to default to the integrated with no way of changing.
