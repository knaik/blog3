I'm having a bad day, I found out that I am not going to be able to Rutgers. I had a very good discussion with the Anne. She appreciated my feedback but I learned that gyms are going to be restricted. I got a new chromebook but I am returning it because I couldn't log in to my edu email because Google's new account management in chromeos just doesn't behave well with duo 2 factor authentication. My current chromebook does 70% of the things that the new one does. In some ways my old chromebook is better. I feel extra isolated today.
