Globalization of music. A friend asked me an interesting question, what makes me connect easily to music from different cultures? I thought about it for a second and then realized that my foundation of music is edm, even before edm was a thing. Discovery by Daft Punk. French Techno. Children, that one trance song. What cultural identity do they embody? To some degree, they borrow from everything, people argue that Discovery would never be released today due to the red tape from all of the original samples used.
