I realized you can install sqlite3 and root in the termux shell. There is also. proot that I haven't explored as much. I decided to buy my first fitness band/watch and it seems like a decent community of hackers are interested and group made an app to access most of the features as well as export wallgardedned data. but for that to happen, you would need a specific value/key from table in a rooted place on the phone. Thankfully I am rooted.
