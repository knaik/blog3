I have to decide between a 700 ryzen with shitty screen or a really nice screen and shitty graphics. or pay 1500+ for something heavy. or go back to a ThinkPad. I can't decide. I really want a chromebook but even that, I would need a normal windows laptop so I don't have to do workarounds for my power uses. No hevc hardware decoding on my current chromebook. no dbpoweramp.

If I get a laptop for 7-800, is it worth to get a 4.4lb laptop instead of a "ultrabook".
