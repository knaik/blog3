This blog is a "secret" blog where I challenged myself to blog everyday, it's messy and text only and my main challenge has been to blog every single day, no matter what, no matter how little and no matter how difficult finding data/wifi might be while travelling. 

The link to this blog is [knaik.github.io/blog3](knaik.github.io/blog3)  or you can go to the _posts part in the repo, since it's all in markdown or the commits and see my raw thinking outside 

The main blog is the [knaik.github.io/](knaik.github.io)  page, and that's a little messy but has more fleshed out writing and more interesting articles.
